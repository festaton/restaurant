			<p> The Red Umbrella is a family owned restaurant that was 
			established in 1980 by Jack and Jill Smith and their four 
			children. They all came to Bloomington from New York City
			to find the Midwest charm, and find it they did! They decided
			to start a restaurant and serve the wonderful people of Indiana. 
			The name comes from an umbrella that Jack's grandfather gave him
			in Paris as a parting gift. It was red and he still has it 
			decorated in the restaurant to this day. </p>
